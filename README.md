## What

Laravel Projectable Aggregates is a package that allows you to **easily storage aggregate values like counts, sums, averages**, etc. in your models eliminating the need to **calculate these values on the fly** (with `withCount`, `withStum`, `withAvg`, etc.).

## Installation

```bash
composer require romanzipp/laravel-projectable-aggregates
```

## Usage

### Terminology

#### Consumers ðŸŸ¢

Consumers hold the projectable aggregate database field. This is the model which otherwise would calculate the relationship fields via `withCount`, `withStum`, `withAvg`, etc.

#### Providers ðŸ”µ

Providing models provide (duh) the aggregate values for the consumer. Think of the provider to exist many times for one consumer.
