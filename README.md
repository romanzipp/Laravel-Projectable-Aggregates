## What

Laravel Projectable Aggregates is a package that allows you to **easily storage aggregate values like counts, sums, averages**, etc. in your models eliminating the need to **calculate these values on the fly** (with `withCount`, `withSum`, `withAvg`, etc.).

- **Speed up database queries** by storing aggregate values in the database.
- **Automatically updates** aggregate values with [Model Events](https://laravel.com/docs/events).
- Option to calculate the aggregate values **periodically in bulk**.

## Installation

```bash
composer require romanzipp/laravel-projectable-aggregates
```

## Terminology

#### üü¢ Consumers 

Consumers hold the projectable aggregate database field. This is the model which otherwise would calculate the relationship fields via `withCount`, `withSum`, `withAvg`, etc.

#### üîµ Providers

Providing models provide (duh) the aggregate values for the consumer. Think of the provider to exist many times for one consumer.

## Usage

Let's continue with the example of a `Car` model with `Door` models. We want to store the Doors count in the Car's `project_doors_count` field.

### 1. Add a Projection Field to DB

```php
new class() extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('cars', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->unsignedInteger('project_doors_count')->default(0);
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Update your Models

#### üü¢ Car (Consumer)

The consumer model will attach the [`ConsumesProjectableAggregate`](src/Attributes/ConsumesProjectableAggregate.php) attribute to the provider relation.

```php
use romanzipp\ProjectableAggregates\Attributes\ConsumesProjectableAggregate;
use romanzipp\ProjectableAggregates\ProjectionAggregateType;

class Car extends Model
{
    #[ConsumesProjectableAggregate(
        projectionAttribute: 'project_doors_count',   // <- Name of the projection field in the database
        projectionType: ProjectionAggregateType::TYPE_COUNT
    )]
    public function doors(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Door::class);
    }
}
```

#### üîµ Door (Provider)

The provider model will attach the [`ProvidesProjectableAggregate`](src/Attributes/ProvidesProjectableAggregate.php) attribute to the consumer relation.

```php
use romanzipp\ProjectableAggregates\Attributes\ProvidesProjectableAggregate;
use romanzipp\ProjectableAggregates\ProjectionAggregateType;

class Door extends Model
{
    #[ProvidesProjectableAggregate(
        projectionAttribute: 'project_doors_count',   // <- Name of the FOREIGN projection field in the database
        projectionType: ProjectionAggregateType::TYPE_COUNT
    )]
    public function car(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Car::class);
    }
}
```

### 3. Register the Projection Aggregates

In order to listen to model events issued by the provider models, you need to register the consumer models in the `boot` method of your `AppServiceProvider`.

```php
use romanzipp\ProjectableAggregates\ProjectableAggregateRegistry;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(ProjectableAggregateRegistry $registry)
    {
        $registry->registerConsumers([
            Car::class,
        ]);

        $registry->registerProviders([
            Door::class,
        ]);
    }
}
```

## Documentation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Calculating aggregate values (without bulk) **relies on Elouent model events** which are only dispatched when working with Eloquent model itself. Using the `DB` facade will **not trigger** the library to update the aggregate values.

### Aggregate Types

There are three types of aggregates that can be calculated:

- `ProjectionAggregateType::TYPE_COUNT`: Counts the number of related models.
- `ProjectionAggregateType::TYPE_SUM`: Sums the related models' values.
- `ProjectionAggregateType::TYPE_AVG`: Averages the related models' values.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In order to use the aggregate types `TYPE_SUM` and `TYPE_AVG`, you need to specify the target attribute of the relationship.
> ```php
> #[ProvidesProjectableAggregate(
>     projectionAttribute: 'project_price_average',
>     projectionType: ProjectionAggregateType::TYPE_AVG,
>     targetAttribute: 'price',                          // <- Attribute of the related model to average/sum up
> )]
> ```

### Triggers

You can decide if you would only like to rely on **models events** or if you want to calculate the aggregate values **periodically in bulk**.

#### Rely on Model Events

This will automatically work if your've attached the [`ProvidesProjectableAggregate`](src/Attributes/ProvidesProjectableAggregate.php) attribute to your provider relations. Once a provider model has been created/deleted the according consumer aggregate attribute will be incremented/decremented.

#### Calculate periodically in Bulk

If you don't want to or can't rely on model events, you can use the `bulk-aggregate` command to calculate the aggregate values periodically in bulk.

```bash
php artisan aggregates:bulk-aggregate {--queued} {--queue=} {--class=}
```

- `--queued`: Dispatch a job to the worker queue.
- `--queue=`: Specify the queue to run the command in.
- `--class=`: Limit the bulk calculation to a specific consumer class.

### Relationships

The following relationships are supported and tested:

#### [`Provider::belongsTo()`](tests/Support/BasicProvider.php) <-> [`Consumer::hasMany()`](tests/Support/BasicConsumer.php)  
- ‚úÖ Model Events  
- ‚úÖ Bulk Aggregation

#### [`Provider::hasOneThrough()`](tests/Support/PivotProvider.php) <-> `Pivot` <-> [`Consumer::hasManyThrough()`](tests/Support/PivotConsumer.php) ‚ö†Ô∏è WIP  
- ‚ùå Model Events  
- ‚úÖ Bulk Aggregation

#### [`Provider::morphTo()`](tests/Support/MorphBasicProvider.php) <-> [`Consumer::morphMany()`](tests/Support/MorphBasicConsumer.php)
- ‚úÖ Model Events
- ‚úÖ Bulk Aggregation

## Testing

This repository contains a [Lando](https://lando.dev) configuration file that can be used to run the tests on your local machine.

```bash
lando start
```

```
lando phpunit
```
